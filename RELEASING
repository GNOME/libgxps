Here are the steps to follow to create a new libgxps release:

1) Ensure that there are no local, uncommitted modifications.
   It's probably good enough if "git diff HEAD" doesn't output
   anything and your "master" and "origin" branchs are at the current
   revision.

2) Fill out an entry in the NEWS file

        Sift through the logs since the last release. This is most
        easily done with a comand such as:

                git log --stat X.Y.Z..

        where X.Y.Z is the previous release version.

        Summarize major changes briefly in a style similar to other
        entries in NEWS. Take special care to note any additions in
        the API. These should be easy to find by noting modifications
        to .h files in the log command above. And more specifically,
        the following command will show each patch that has changed a
        public header file since the given version:

                find libgxps -name 'gxps*.h' ! -name '*-private.h' \
                ! -name 'gxps-archive.h' ! -name 'gxps-debug.h' \
                ! -name 'gxps-fonts.h' ! -name 'gxps-images.h' \
                ! -name 'gxps-parse-utils.h' | xargs git log -p X.Y.Z.. --

3) Increment gxps_{minor|micro}_version and LT_{CURRENT|REVISION|AGE}
   in configure.ac:

        If there are API additions, then increment gxps_minor_version
        and reset gxps_micro_version to 0.

        Otherwise, (ie. there are only bug fixes), increment
        gxps_micro_version to the next larger number.

        Adjust LT_CURRENT, LT_REVISION, and LT_AGE as described in the
        comments in configure.ac.

4) Verify that the code passes "make distcheck"

        First, make sure you have 'nm' and 'readelf' commands in PATH.
        this should be Ok with any Linux distro.

        Running "make distcheck" should result in no warnings or
        errors and end with a message of the form:

        ==================================================
        libgxps-X.Y.Z archives ready for distribution:
        libgxps-X.Y.Z.tar.bz2
        ==================================================

        (But the tar file isn't actually ready yet, as we still have
        some more steps to follow).

5) Commit the changes to NEWS and configure.ac and push

        It's especially important to mention the new version number in your
        commit log.

6) Tag the release with the following command:

        git tag -s -m "libgxps X.Y.Z release" X.Y.Z

7) Push the newly created tag out to the central tree with a command
   something like:

        git push origin X.Y.Z

8) Upload the tarball to ftp.gnome.org, by scp-ing it to
   master.gnome.org:

        scp libgxps-X.Y.Z.tar.bz2 (username)@master.gnome.org:

9) ssh into master.gnome.org and call ftpadmin install command:

        ftpadmin install libgxps-X.Y.Z.tar.bz2

10) Send a message to announce the new release to gnome-announce-list@gnome.org
